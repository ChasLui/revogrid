# Updates for version 3.0
Version 3.0 introduces breaking changes:
- Removed viewport component, this extra layer was redundant;
- Changed classes to complex names in order to support bootstrap and other libraries:
    - row -> rgRow;
    - col -> rgCol;
    - data-cell -> rgCell;
    - data-header-cell -> rgHeaderCell;
- All methods migrated to lowercase in order to support the modern approach of event naming. It means events name migration: `afterEdit` -> `afteredit` for all events. Check api for details;
- Added pure esm modules support in order to use the grid in all modern frontend tooling like vitejs, parcel etc, now you can import custom-elements without lazy loading, just keep in mind you are responsible for polyfills.
