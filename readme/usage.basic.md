## Basic Usage

RevoGrid functions as a web component. Simply place the component on your page and access its properties as you would with any other HTML element. It also offers multiple ways to integrate our grid into your project:

- [Import the grid into your index.html file](./docs/indexhtml.md)
- [Import as a module with lazy loading](./docs/indexmodule.md)
- [Import using builders like Webpack with lazy loading](./docs/webpack.md)
- [Import as an ESM module without lazy loading](./docs/custom.element.md)
